Due to privacy terms, data set will not be posted.
### 2. Model used
Model trained in the uploaded notebook file uses xgboost. Process of tuning hyperparameters is not included.  
### 3. GCP integration
Parts of code are about GCP integration processes. However, final version of my work just test the data locally and not use GCP.
